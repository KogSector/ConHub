We are building a knowledge layer and context engine where we will allow users to connect data sources like repositories (from multiple providers), docs (from Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, local file system, etc.), Notion, Confluence, JIRA, etc., and even URLs for direct data from certain websites for better accuracy. Then we embed, index and do whatever necessary to convert it in a format suitable for AI agents to understand and use MCP to connect these data to AI agents of user's choice such at GitHub Copilot, Cline, Trae, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.

So we connect data sources and agents. We embed and index the sources and make them properly available for AI agents. Also we create a system for rules which can be shared by all AI agents and agentic softwares.
