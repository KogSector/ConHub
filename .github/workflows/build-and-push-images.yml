# This GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes Docker images for all microservices to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
#
# To use this workflow, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
#
# 1. AZURE_CREDENTIALS: A JSON object containing your Azure service principal credentials.
#    You can create a service principal with the required permissions (AcrPush) and generate credentials using the Azure CLI:
#    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "GitHubActions" --role "AcrPush" --scopes "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/{acr-name}" --sdk-auth
#
# 2. ACR_NAME: The name of your Azure Container Registry.
#
# For more details on configuring secrets, see the GitHub documentation:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets
#
